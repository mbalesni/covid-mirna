hsa-mir-4732,circulation_biomarker_diagnosis_down,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,29873187,"Although the levels of many miRNAs were unaffected after passage through the plasma adsorption membrane, expression of some miRNAs, including miR-1246, miR-4732-5p, and miR-6088 are declined",NO
hsa-mir-4732,circulation_biomarker_diagnosis_ns,"Colitis, Ulcerative",26569605,"This is the first study to show the differential expression of miRNA involving different sites of colon in UC patients. Taking our data and previous reports into consideration, we propose that differential miRNA expression during UC perhaps contribute in the development of UC-associated CRC at the rectosigmoid area.",NO

hsa-mir-4732,target gene,Neoplasms [unspecific],23886136,From our findings we propose designing further studies focused on overexpression of miRNA-4732-5p and introducing different mutations in the overlapping region of wrap53 and p53 genes in order to study their effects on p53 and its δN isoform (δ40p53) expression. The results may provide new pieces in the p53 targeting puzzle for cancer therapy.,NO
