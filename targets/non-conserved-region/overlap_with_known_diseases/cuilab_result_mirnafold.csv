hsa-mir-576,circulation_biomarker_diagnosis_ns,Glioma,24858071,miRNA profile of the peripheral blood may serve as a new biomarker for glioma diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity.,NO
hsa-mir-576,other,"Carcinoma, Bladder",28338199,MiR-576-3p is a novel marker correlated with poor clinical outcome in bladder cancer.,NO
hsa-mir-576,other,Melanoma,30197759,"miR-193b and miR-30c-1* inhibit, whereas miR-576-5p enhances melanoma cell invasion in vitro.",NO
hsa-mir-576,target gene,Bladder Neoplasms,25556372,miR-576-3p might be a novel suppressor of bladder cancer cell proliferation through targeting cyclin D1.,YES
hsa-mir-576,therapeutic target,Breast Neoplasms,25451164,"we identified 10 dysregulated miRNAs in both breast cancer cells and chemoresistant tissues, which might be biomarkers for the prognosis of breast cancer chemoresistance. Our study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of prognostic biomarkers during clinical treatment, and we hypothesize that the miRNA signatures of drug-resistant carcinoma tissues could be useful for developing new strategies for targeted therapies in patients with chemoresistant breast cancer.",NO
hsa-mir-576,tissue_expression_ns,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",26229398,"In summary, all the reported results suggest that differences in miRNA expression exist between HCV-related and HCV-negative NHLs, and further studies will be useful to ascertain if miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of HCV-related lymphomas and whether they can be used as biomarkers.",NO
hsa-mir-576,tissue_expression_up,Colorectal Carcinoma,22740910,"Overexpression of miR-145, miR-1, miR-146a, miR-576-5p, miR-126*, HS287, miR-28-5p, miR-143, miR-199b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-10b, miR-22, miR-133b, miR-145*, miR-199a, miR-133a, miR-125b and downregulation of miR-31 and HS170 were observed in brain-metastatic carcinomas.",NO
